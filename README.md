# cloudscribe.StarterKits

All of these samples are intended as something you could copy and use to start your own ASP.NET Core project in Visual Studio 2015. The WebApp in each solution is yours to customize and add your own custom functionality. There is no "cloudscribe" source code in the samples they only have NuGet dependencies on cloudscribe libraries and the have been configured with example Startup.cs code to get things working.

## SimpleContent with SimpleAuth and NoDb

[available now](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe.StarterKits/tree/master/SimpleContent-SimpleAuth-nodb)

[SimpleContent](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe.SimpleContent) is a simple, yet flexible content and blog engine for ASP.NET Core.

This sample uses [cloudscribe SimpleAuth](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe.Web.SimpleAuth) for user authentication and uses [NoDb](https://github.com/joeaudette/NoDb) file system storage for content and data. 

[Simple Auth](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe.Web.SimpleAuth) is a bare bones authentication system for when only a few pre-configured users will need to login. It does not require a database, the users are configured form a json file in the root of the application. It has a smaller attack surface than more complex identity solutions because of the reduced complexity.

[NoDb](https://github.com/joeaudette/NoDb) is a "No Database" file system storage, it is also a "NoSql" storage system.

This sample is pre-populated with sample data, when you run it you can login with admin as the username and admin as the password.

Be sure to update the credentials before deployment.
