# cloudscribe.StarterKits

All of these samples are intended as something you could copy and use to start your own ASP.NET Core project in Visual Studio 2015. The WebApp in each solution is yours to customize and add your own custom functionality. There is no "cloudscribe" source code in the samples they only have NuGet dependencies on cloudscribe libraries and the have been configured with example Startup.cs code to get things working.
